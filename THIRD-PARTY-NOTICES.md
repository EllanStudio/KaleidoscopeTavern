# Third-Party Notices

Kaleidoscope Tavern embeds Sparrow YAML for its operator-owned configuration
files. It also builds against third-party server APIs whose classes are not
bundled in the release JAR; server operators must install those runtime
dependencies separately. The build audits both boundaries.

## Build and test tools

Gradle, the Foojay toolchain resolver, JUnit, and their transitive dependencies
are used only to build or test the project and are not bundled in the plugin
JAR. The tracked Gradle Wrapper JAR contains its own `META-INF/LICENSE` notice.

This notice is informational and does not replace any upstream license text.
The Kaleidoscope Tavern source-code and artistic-resource licenses are provided
separately as `LICENSE-CODE` and `LICENSE-ASSETS`.
